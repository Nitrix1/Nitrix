# Info
Hi! I'm Nitrix, a high school student developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Lua.

# What I do
I don't focus on one specific area of development, I do lots of things. I like coding discord bots, building games and models, and making websites! Some of my other hobbies include Arduino projects, designing models in CAD, and I'm working on becoming a student pilot.
My page is pretty empty right now, I'm working on getting more comfortable with JS, HTML, and CSS.
